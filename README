Creating a Menu File
====================

Menus are generated from plain text files, and they follow a very similar structure

```
#named separator
category
  item:cmd
  #named separator
  item:cmd
  ---
  subcategory
    item:cmd
    item:cmd
    item:cmd
item:cmd
item:cmd
```

- Where `---` is a separator, without any text.
- Identation (2 spaces) controls the scope of the menus.
- For commands to be run on a terminal emulator with `item name:@T cmd`, `@T` will
  be converted to a terminal command, by default `st -e` is used.
